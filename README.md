# HackTheStack
Hack the Stack was a competition ran in Dec 2016, when I was President of the Purdue IEEE Computer Society. Teams competed against each other in a series of hacking tasks, and winners received prizes. The hacker needed to know cross-site scripting, sql injection, cookie hacking, malforming upload requests, buffer overflows, metasploit and password hashing schemes. In each folder is info on the task and the code that runs it. Some stuff was changed during the competition to adjust for difficulty. If you are running a similar competition or have questions, please let me know!
